## Config Settings:

### General Settings:
- **Set Default Sorting** for the moon catalogue. Options are "default" (level ID), "name", "prefix", "grade/hazard level", "price", "weather", "difficulty" (equation soon to be customizable, NOT the same as grade), or the reverse of any of them.

- **Hide the Company**, A.K.A "71 Gordion", from the moon catalogue. On by default.

- **Pad Prefixes** with zeroes for a more uniform look. For example, "8 Titan", "21 Offense", and "220 Assurance" would become "008 Titan", "021 Offense", and "220 Assurance".

- **Show Clear Weather** in the moon catalogue. If false, the "weather" section of moons with no current weather will be left blank.

- **Evenly List Moons** in the moon catalogue rather than separating them according to their sort. For example, if true, moons will be divided into groups of three instead of being divided by grade, price, etc.

- **Show Full-length Weather Names** in the moon catalogue. Will create second rows to display extra-long weather names. If false, extra-long weather names will be truncated to "Complex". NOTE: All vanilla weathers will fit on the terminal! This is solely for mods that have longer weather names.

- **Show the Detailed Terminal Scan** instead of the vanilla one. Will display a list of every scrap with their values, weights, and properties (whether or not the scrap is two-handed, conductive, a weapon, or battery-powered) along with a summarizing bar-graph. See the image above for an example.

- **Set Custom Difficulty Equation** for when sorting the moon catalogue by difficulty. Choose any collection of nine different variables and give them each weights.
Possible Variables:
    - Enemy Power Count (for daytime, nighttime, and inside)
    - Total Enemy Types (for daytime, nighttime, and inside)
    - Interior Size
    - Current Weather
    - Average Scrap Value

### Moon Settings:
- **Enable the Moon Config** for the current moon.

- **Set a Custom Name** for the moon.

- **Set a Custom Prefix** (the number before the name) for the moon.

- **Set a Custom Grade / Hazard Level** for the moon (i.e. the letter grade).

- **Set a Custom Price** for the moon.

- **Set a Custom Description** for the moon (the flavor text on the main monitor).

- **Set a Custom Info Page** for the moon (i.e. the text when when you enter in "[PlanetName] info").

### Misc. Settings:

- **Kilroy was here.**
